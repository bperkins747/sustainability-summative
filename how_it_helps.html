      <h3>A "mitigation" or "adaptation" solution?</h3>
      <p>Two types of climate solutions include "mitigation" solutions, which affect the source of a climate problem in order to prevent its increase in the future, and "adaptation" solutions, which protect against the growing effects of our impact on the climate. This solution is a mitigation solution, since it prevents forest populations, important to the function of the Earth's natural carbon cycle, from being reduced, helping to prevent future damage that may also have even more of an impact. By keeping forests intact, the carbon cycle can continue to function by transferring carbon out of the atmosphere and reducing the resulting climate change, which may have other positive effects, such as reducing the rate of ocean warming and sea level rise <a class="in-text-citation" href="./public/reference_list/reference_list.pdf">(Friedel 2017)</a>.</p>

      <h3>How the solution works</h3>
      <p>By creating international restrictions, businesses and organizations worldwide are pushed to find ways to continue forward without being affected or punished under these laws, requiring developing more sustainable solutions. One example of this is in vertical farming, an environmentally-sustainable method of farming that also increases food stability and social sustainability as a result (Yang, 2019). Currently, similar laws have been put in place in some individual nations <a class="in-text-citation" href="./public/reference_list/reference_list.pdf">(Azevedo et al., 2017; <i>Illegal Logging</i>, n.d.)</a>, but these are not worldwide, meaning that nations that still have not put these safeguards in place let unsustainable practices continue without risk, and there is no push for more environmentally-friendly methods to be developed. These restrictions also create an immediate impact on the root cause of the problem itself by actually limiting the amount that logging can reduce forests <a class="in-text-citation" href="./public/reference_list/reference_list.pdf">(Azevedo et al., 2017; <i>Illegal Logging</i>, n.d.)</a>. Even though there is always the potential for laws not to be followed, giving these laws high authority through international powers will mean that many or most businesses and organizations will not risk new possible consequences, so there will still be a great impact on overall deforestation. These two effects of the law, preserving Earth's forests while pushing for more sustainable solutions to be developed across nations worldwide, will help the rate of greenhouse gas increase in the atmosphere to be slowed.</p>
