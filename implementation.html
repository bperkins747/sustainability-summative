      <h3>Putting laws into effect</h3>
      <p>In order to put these laws into full effect, groups like the UN would be able to give these laws the international authority that is needed. Groups advocating for these plans should be encouraged to push their ideas to these international organizations, in order to make creating and delivering these laws a priority. Also, once a plan has been decided, a team should be put together in order to research how restrictive these laws should be at first, and how restrictions should be tightened as times change going forward. Starting with lighter restrictions in order to give a warning signal, while tightening restrictions later in order to make real, significant progress is a good likely strategy for these laws, since it lets those regulations serve their purpose while also leaving room and time to adapt.</p>

      <h3>Possible expenses involved</h3>
      <p>One possible way that this plan could create cost is in the legal punishment given to businesses operating outside of the restrictions once they are put into effect, for example, in the form of fines. Also, during the time needed to develop more sustainable solutions to replace old, unmaintainable strategies, some cost might come from the lowered ability to operate that businesses and organizations might experience while developing new solutions. Costs might come, too, from the research required to develop those new strategies, such as the cost of assembling a team, and later the cost of equipment needed to put these new strategies in place. However, in the longer-term, more sustainable practices have actually shown to be profitable, for example, the Egyptian organic farm Sekem used sustainable methods to create an efficient beginning-to-end production process, and gained benefits such as a higher-quality cotton crop and a near-30% total average yield increase over some time <a class="in-text-citation" href="./public/reference_list/reference_list.pdf">(Haanaes et al., 2013)</a>. As well, Dell was reported to have saved almost $2 million between about 2014 and 2019 through their plastic recycling program <a class="in-text-citation" href="./public/reference_list/reference_list.pdf">(Collins, 2019)</a>.</p>
