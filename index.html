      <h3>The Solution</h3>
      <p>One solution to the problem of worldwide deforestation may be to introduce international regulations, similar to current laws passed nationally in some countries, such as Brazil's "Forest Code" <span class="in-text-citation">(Azevedo et al., 2017)</span>. Laws like these help to protect forests by preventing over-logging past a certain amount. Laws like these also have the effect of pushing businesses and organizations to develop more sustainable methods of work, through limiting the amount that those organizations can rely on raw logging as a strategy for any purpose. For example, if a company aims to produce more food, but needs more farmland, they may normally clear more forested land to create the needed open space. However, with restrictions, they are encouraged to find alternative methods, for example, using vertical farming, which has been proven to be more environmentally sustainable and also benefits social sustainability through increased food stability <span class="in-text-citation">(Yang, 2019)</span>.</p>

      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>This solution aims to solve the issue of the worldwide deforestation that has resulted in the severe reduction of the planet's forest, especially tree, populations, which are essential to keeping our already-unsustainable carbon emissions under control. Decreasing forests reduces the habitats for increasingly endangered animals, like orangutans and jaguars, as well as plants <span class="in-text-citation">(Gao et al., 2020; <i>The Effects of Deforestation</i>, n.d.; Williams, 2019)</span>. Decreasing biodiversity  in this way also means that there will be less and less of certain organisms available to perform the jobs that once put the planet's essential resources, like carbon and water, in the right places <span class="in-text-citation">(Williams, 2019)</span>. One example of this is in the disruption this causes in the carbon cycle by reducing the trees that otherwise naturally absorb atmospheric carbon. Without nearly as many trees, more carbon is left in the atmosphere, where it can cause global climate change, which causes other problems.</p>

      <h3>The Carbon Cycle</h3>
      <p>The planet's carbon cycle is the process that places natural carbon in needed places, through processes such as the intake of carbon by plants from the atmosphere, which relocates atmospheric carbon to the planet's "biosphere". If the carbon cycle is disrupted, too much carbon may end in one place, where amounts increasing above natural levels may cause problems not seen naturally. Deforestation removes trees in mass numbers from ecosystems worldwide, which prevents a large part of the carbon in the atmosphere from being able to transfer to the biosphere. This allows even more carbon than already is in the atmosphere, because of unsustainable emissions through processes like burning fossil fuels, to stay, which has an effect on global temperatures, and as a result causes many other negative side-effects. Reducing deforestation and encouraging sustainable practices will allow the carbon cycle to be left to complete its processes in a more natural way (Friedel, 2017).</p>
